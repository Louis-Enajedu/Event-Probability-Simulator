# Event Probability Simulator

## Overview
This project is an Event Probability Simulator i designed. It simulates the probability of different outcomes for given scenarios, allowing users to input parameters for simulations, such as the number of trials and event probabilities. Additionally, it utilizes Bayes' theorem for scenarios requiring probability updates based on new information.

## Features
- Simulate event probabilities based on user-defined parameters.
- Calculate permutations and combinations to model different scenarios.
- Apply Bayes' theorem for updated probabilities.
- Interactive user input for scenario parameters.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. This project also requires the NumPy library. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
